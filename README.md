# Template for your website

This repository contains all files for the implementation phase of your project. 

You are free to re-structure this repository to your liking, but make sure that you have a system and it's not chaotic!

If you are unsure, just use the template as given. Your repository is structured the following way:

`./www`: here you can store the html or php files

`./www/images`: this is the folder in which you store all your images

`./www/styles`: this is the folder for your css files

You can create more folders if you need them! Separate images from music files, find a good place to store documentation that you may need, and so on!

## Start the application

1. Copy or rename the `my.env-example` file to `.env`, make sure the leading 'dot' stays there.
2. Only Linux and MacOS users, change the values of `UID` and `GID` according to your system
     - To get the correct values, in the terminal type the following commands for `UID` and `GID` respecively:
        - `id -u`
        - `id -g`
3. Open a terminal at the location of this README file
    - Open a terminal and use `cd` to get to the correct location
    - Or right click in finder/explorer and `Open in terminal`
4. To start the application type the following command:
    - `docker-compose up -d`
    - It may take a while on the first start :)
5. Open your favorite browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1/](http://127.0.0.1/) or [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) and it should show a page indicating that everything is working.
6. To stop the docker containters run the following command:
    - `docker-compose stop`
7. Now it is also possible to start/stop the container from Docker Desktop
