# Template for your website

This repository contains all files for the implementation phase of your project. 

You are free to re-structure this repository to your liking, but make sure that you have a system and it's not chaotic!

If you are unsure, just use the template as given. Your repository is structured the following way:

`./www`: here you can store the html or php files

`./www/images`: this is the folder in which you store all your images

`./www/styles`: this is the folder for your css files

You can create more folders if you need them! Separate images from music files, find a good place to store documentation that you may need, and so on!
